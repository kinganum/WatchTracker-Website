# Mobile Optimization & Responsiveness Guide

This document outlines the strategies and best practices implemented to ensure the WatchTracker application provides a first-class user experience on mobile devices.

## 1. Progressive Web App (PWA) for Offline Persistence

The application is a PWA, which significantly enhances the mobile experience. This means:
- **Installable**: Users can add WatchTracker to their home screen from their mobile browser, allowing it to launch full-screen like a native app.
- **Persistent Storage**: The app's offline data, stored in IndexedDB, is not cleared when the user clears their general browser history. This makes the offline mode and sync queue robust and reliable, ensuring no data is lost.
- **Offline Access**: Thanks to the service worker, the application shell loads instantly, even without an internet connection.

## 2. Responsive Layout Strategy

The application follows a **mobile-first** design philosophy using Tailwind CSS's responsive utility variants (`sm`, `md`, `lg`).

- **Default Styles**: Base styles are targeted at small (mobile) viewports.
- **Breakpoints**: Larger screen styles are applied at specific breakpoints.
  - `sm` (640px): Small tablets and landscape phones.
  - `md` (768px): Tablets.
  - `lg` (1024px): Laptops and desktops.
- **Key Responsive Components**:
  - **Watchlist Grid**: Stacks to a single column on mobile, transitioning to 2 columns on `sm` screens and 3 on `lg` screens. (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`).
  - **Filter Controls**: The filter bar stacks into a single, easy-to-use vertical layout on mobile. On `md` screens and up, it becomes a horizontal, wrapping row. Filter dropdowns and buttons become full-width on mobile for easier interaction.
  - **Forms**: The `ManualPasteForm` and `SmartPasteForm` on the homepage are arranged in a 2-column layout on `lg` screens but stack vertically on smaller devices.

## 3. Touch Targets & Interaction

To ensure usability on touch devices, all interactive elements adhere to mobile guidelines.

- **Minimum Size**: All buttons, icons, and interactive controls have a minimum tap area of **40x40px**. This is primarily achieved on the `WatchlistItemCard`'s action buttons by setting an explicit height and width (`h-10 w-10`).
- **Tactile Feedback**: To provide immediate feedback upon interaction, `active:scale-95` and other `active:` variants are used on buttons. This gives a satisfying "press" effect.
- **Mobile-Friendly Forms**: Numeric inputs (`season`, `episode`, `part`) use `type="number"` and `inputMode="numeric"` to trigger the appropriate mobile keyboard, simplifying data entry.

## 4. Performance & Perceived Speed

- **Component Memoization**: `React.memo` is used on the `WatchlistItemCard` component. Since the watchlist can grow large, this prevents unnecessary re-renders of list items that haven't changed, significantly improving performance during filtering, sorting, or real-time updates.
- **Optimistic UI**: The application's existing optimistic UI pattern is crucial for a fast perceived performance on mobile, where network latency can be higher.
- **Smooth Animations**: Animations are kept minimal and use performant CSS properties (`transform`, `opacity`). The highlight-on-add animation provides a clear visual cue without causing layout shifts.

## 5. Accessibility

- **Reduced Motion**: A global CSS rule is in place to respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. If a user has this setting enabled, all non-essential animations and transitions are disabled.
- **ARIA Attributes**:
  - Toast notifications are wrapped in a `div` with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to ensure they are announced by screen readers.
  - Interactive elements like status filters use `aria-pressed` to indicate their current state.

## 6. Future Considerations

- **Virtualization**: If user watchlists are expected to commonly exceed ~150-200 items, implementing a virtualized list (e.g., with TanStack Virtual) would be the next step to maintain high performance.
